changelog=Version 1.5.0: Added new Processing algorithms: "Generate Protoblocks from OSM Data in Bounding Box", "Generate Full Sidewalk Network (from Polygon)", and "Generate Full Sidewalk Network (from BBOX)". Refined help strings and parameter descriptions for all algorithms. Ensured consistent presentation in Processing Toolbox.\nVersion 1.4.0: Added Processing provider with an algorithm to generate protoblocks from OSM data within an input polygon. Files reorganized. Marked as experimental.\nVersion 1.3.1: Removed Shapely Dependency! Codebase went through formatting. Tested on 3.40.
